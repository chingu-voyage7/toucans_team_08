# Setup at the time of writing!

This is a Ruby on Rails project. In order to get this running in your local environment, you must have ruby (2.3.7 at the time of writing) and rails (5.1.6.1 at the time of writing) installed (Google how to install rails for your OS if it's not installed -- sorry Windows users.) 

Once cloned and ruby and rails are installed, run `bundle install` (if you don't have Bundler installed (or get an error), run `gem install bundler`
Once that is complete, start your local server by running:
`bin/rails s -p <choose a 4 digit number for your port>` i.e `bin/rails s -p 3000`, or `bundle exec rails s -p 3000` (all a matter of preference)

##### H5 Hooray, you're one step closer to checking out our awesome app!

Now, just point your browser to `localhost:3000` (or whatever you put for your four digit port number), and play. Hopefully this will get better as time goes by!
